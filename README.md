# LinkedList Recursion 

C++ implementation of two programs, one is a recursive function to split a sorted singly-linked list into two sorted linked lists where one linked list stores the even numbers and the other stores the odd numbers, and the other  focuses on an unrolled linked list, demonstrating efficient memory utilization by storing multiple elements in each node.
